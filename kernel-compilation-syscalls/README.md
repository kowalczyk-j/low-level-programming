## Minix Kernel compliation and system calls

The aim of the exercise is to familiarise you with the mechanism for implementing system calls. During the exercise, a new system call should be added to the system, returning the process number (index) in the process table. In order to carry out the exercise, you will need your own Minix 2.0 system image
(minix203.img) running in a virtual machine.
