## File System

C program (and a script demonstrating the use of this program) which implements the basic functions of a file system.

The file system should be organised in a large file of a given size, which will be a "virtual disk". The program should create a virtual disk, and perform writes and reads in order to realise basic operations on the disk, related to directory management, file allocation, and maintaining name uniqueness.
